# Face Liveness Detection using Depth Map Prediction

##About the Project
This is an application of a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks and Computer Vision to detect
between actual faces and fake faces in realtime environment. The image frame captured from webcam is passed over a pre-trained model. This model is trained on the depth map of images in the dataset. The depth map generation have been developed from a different CNN model.

Project under continous development.

##Requirements
* Python3
* Tensorflow
* dlib
* numpy
* Imutils
* OpenCV (cv) for python3



Will keep updating the repo.
Stay Tuned.
