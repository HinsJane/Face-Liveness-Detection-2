# Face-Liveness-Detection
Project to detect between actual faces and fake faces in realtime with Computer Vision, Deep Learning

This project aims at distingusihing images using the methods of depth detection and texture analysis.
Initially the files for prediction using depth maps will be present.
##The Dataset used is a personally generated dataset. The dataset cannot be shared.
Project under continuos development.

Will keep updating the repo.
Stay Tuned.
